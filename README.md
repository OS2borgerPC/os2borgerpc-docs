## Purpose
OS2BorgerPC is an open-source solution for computers made available for citizens in libraries, citizen service centers, or other public spaces in Danish municipalities.  
The system is designed to allow citizens to carry out necessary digital tasks such as writing job applications, applying for benefits, paying bills, printing, and communicating with public authorities.  

OS2BorgerPC includes built-in security features that protect users’ personal data, such as automatic logout, automatic deletion of user data, and security alerts.  

OS2BorgerPC is a cost-effective and operationally stable alternative to proprietary software for publicly accessible workstations.  

## Documentation
System documentation is built with [OS2offdig/os2-docs-template](https://github.com/OS2offdig/os2-docs-template) and published via GitHub Pages.
